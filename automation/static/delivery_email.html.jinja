      {{ volunteer.name.split()[0] }}{% if loop.length > 1 %},{% endif %}

  </p>
  <p>
    This is your email with contact information and delivery instructions for
    {{ ticket.request_name.strip() }}, ticket ID <strong>
    {{ ticket.ticket_id }}</strong>. We‚Äôve included a step-by-step checklist,
    plus the complete grocery list(s) below, along with spending guidance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that when you call to coordinate your delivery time if a
    neighbor asks to add additional items and they already have <strong>3
    custom items on their list</strong> please let them know that you can't
    make any additions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thanks so much for being here, and please reach out with any questions!
    <br />

  <h1 style="font-size: 1.17em">Instructions and Best Practices</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>First, call your neighbors.</strong> Please call when you get this
    email, or shortly after - your neighbor will be expecting to hear from you!
    Agree on a good delivery time, confirm their address, and ask any questions
    about their grocery list (i.e. if ‚Äúbaby formula‚Äù do they have a preferred
    brand?).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you can‚Äôt get a hold of someone, please try back a few times, leave a
    message, and text. If there‚Äôs still no response, let us know at <a clicktracking=off
      href="mailto:operations@bedstuystrong.com">operations@bedstuystrong.com</a>
    (just reply to this email).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Shop the grocery list.</strong> Keep yourself safe - wear a mask,
    keep distance when possible, and wash your hands when you get home from
    shopping. Use the list as your guide, and do your best to purchase what
    your neighbor asked for. Be mindful of household size and the spending
    guidance under the shopping list below to determine quantities; you are
    looking to get a week's worth of food for your neighbor. Make sure to take
    a photo of your receipt for the completion form!
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Safely deliver the groceries.</strong> Call/buzz when you arrive,
    then back up 6 feet for COVID safety. Please stick around to say hello and
    make sure they receive the bags. ‚ù§ This is about being in relationship to
    our neighbors üòä Once you‚Äôve dropped off groceries, check in after! A
    simple text to check in / ask how they‚Äôre doing is always appreciated. ‚ù§
  </p>
  <p>
    If you can, <strong>please snap pictures of your volunteering
    efforts</strong> for our communication outputs (social, newsletter, etc.)!
    You can email them directly to us, we‚Äôd greatly appreciate it!
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Fill out the <a clicktracking=off href="https://airtable.com/shrvHf4k5lRo0I8F4">completion form</a></strong>
    to let us know your delivery is complete, and to receive your reimbursement
    within 48 ‚Äì 72 hours.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A note:</strong> Some neighbors will offer or ask about making
    contributions to offset their grocery delivery. Thank them and accept their
    contribution; anything they wish to donate goes right back into more
    groceries for others.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the neighbor hands you cash, you can enter this in the completion
      form to contribute it back into BSS. If you have any questions, email us
      and we will figure out another way to accept the contribution!</li>
    <li>If the neighbor is younger / tech savvy, or notes that they would like
      to donate in the future, feel free to direct them to <a clicktracking=off
        href="https://www.bedstuystrong.com">www.bedstuystrong.com</a> for
      information on how to donate (or share BSS Venmo/Cashapp info)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you have any issues along the way, please reach out to us at <a clicktracking=off
      href="mailto:operations@bedstuystrong.com">operations@bedstuystrong.com</a>
    (or reply to this email) and someone will get back to you.
